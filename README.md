Ever wanted to get yelled at by Chef Ramsay whenever you inevitably fuck up
your script or make a typo on the command line? Well now you can. 

*Introducing: **gordon**, the command line tool for Linux and MacOS that will make you 
feel like a fucking donkey because you can't spell the `quit` command correctly.*

## Installation
Screaming and swearing is just around the corner. Just follow these simple steps:

* Download all the insults from the `insults` directory.
* In `gordon.sh`, set the `RAMSAY_INSULTS` variable to the directory where you saved your insults.
* Place the contents of `gordon.sh` into your `~/.bash_profile`, or source it in to your currently running shell instance.
* Install the additional programs:
    * **Linux:** `apt-get install mpv` (Media player)
    * **Mac OSX:** `brew install coreutils`(gshuf)
* You can also adjust the `play_ramsay_insult` function to call another MP3 audio player of your choice.

That's it! Try messing up on the command line, and enjoy Chef Ramsay's insults.
